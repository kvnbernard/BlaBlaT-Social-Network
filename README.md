# Blabla't : Social Network - L3 Advanced Web Development

**Creation of social network named Blabla't as part of our Advanced Web Development course at CY Tech.**  
The social network consists of a news feed with the latest posts the user has written, as well as posts by people the user follows, all originating from the date the post was published. Users can therefore write posts, and add an image if they wish. They can also write comments under posts, and like posts. They can also search for users by entering their pseudonym or part of it.
